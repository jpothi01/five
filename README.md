# Five

"**Fi**le **V**iew**e**r or "**Fi**le **V**iewer and **E**ditor" -- whichever you prefer.

# Why

Five is a terminal application for quickly browsing, viewing, and editing the text files in a 
directory tree. It is inspired by popular editors such as Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code, but optimized 
for a handful of quick tasks I find myself doing all the time as a programmer.

# How

Open the current directory:
```
five .

# Or just
five
```

Open another directory:
```
five path/to/files
```

Open a remote directory:
```
five root@192.168.0.1:/path/to/remote/files
```
